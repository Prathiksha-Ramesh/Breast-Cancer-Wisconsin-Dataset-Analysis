# Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**. The project includes data preprocessing, exploration, and visualization, leading to the application of machine learning models for classification tasks. The aim is to create an end-to-end workflow that can be used to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
- **Data Exploration**: Summary statistics, visualizing the data distribution, and understanding feature importance.
- **Model Implementation**: Application of machine learning models for classification of tumors.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## File Structure

- `notebook.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
